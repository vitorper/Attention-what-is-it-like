Supplement to Occipital and left temporal instantaneous amplitude and frequency oscillations correlated with access and phenomenal consciousness. Occipital and left temporal instantaneous amplitude and frequency oscillations correlated with access and phenomenal consciousness move from the features of the ERP characterized in Occipital and Left Temporal EEG Correlates of Phenomenal Consciousness (Pereira, 2015) towards the instantaneous amplitude and frequency of event-related changes correlated with a contrast in access and in phenomenology. Occipital and left temporal instantaneous amplitude and frequency oscillations correlated with access and phenomenal consciousness proceed as following.
In the first section, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with post processing (Xie, G., Guo, Y., Tong, S., and Ma, L., 2014. Calculate excess mortality during heatwaves using Hilbert-Huang transform algorithm. BMC medical research methodology, 14, 35) Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (postEEMD) and Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT).

In the second section, calculated the variance inflation factor (VIF).
In the third section, partial least squares regression (PLSR): the minimal root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP).
In the last section, partial least squares regression (PLSR): significance multivariate correlation (sMC) statistic.
